<h2> Winning the Game </h2>

In this year's competition, teams play against each other on a grid of size ranging from 32x32 to 64x64.  Each team has an HQ, other buildings, and an army of units, and the game ends when one of the HQs is destroyed.  This can happen in two ways:
<ol>
  <li> An HQ is buried in dirt
  <li> An HQ is flooded
</ol>

<h3> Burying Buildings in Dirt </h3>
Arguably the most important unit in the game is the landscaper, which can pick up dirt from any square adjacent to itself and then deposit that dirt on another adjacent square.  Piling a sufficient amount of dirt on a building will crush it, so burying the enemy buildings (and removing dirt from your own buildings) is the primary method of attack.  In particular, depositing 50 dirt on the enemy HQ (in excess of what they managed to remove) will automatically win the game.

<h3> Flooding </h3>
Each tile on the board has a starting elevation, which is changed whenever landscapers add or remove dirt.  Over the course of the game, the global water level rises, slowly at first, but exponentially faster as the game progresses.  At the end of each round, the floodwaters spread from water tiles to any adjacent tile whose elevation is lower than the global water level.  The HQ can be defended (although not indefinitely) by surrounding it with a high wall and hoping the opponent's HQ floods first.

<h2> Types of Robots </h2>
To help you on this mission of burying the enemy HQ and/or surviving the flood, your team is allowed to construct multiple types of robots with different abilities.

Robots are classified into two types: units and buildings.  Units can move around the map (at a rate of 1 square per action; diagonal movements are allowed).  Buildings can never be moved once they are built and are destroyed by being covered in a sufficient amount of dirt (which varies by building).

<h3> Landscapers </h3>
We have already seen this robot, which can move dirt around.  Each turn, it can either pick up or deposit one unit of dirt.  Landscapers can carry a maximum of 25 dirt, which can be useful when moving it around the map.

<h3> Miners </h3>
Miners are the worker units of the game.  They are the only units that can construct buildings.  They also, collect the resource of the game, soup, which must be spent in order to construct other robots.

The map is initially populated with multiple soup deposits, totaling tens of thousands of soup.  A miner can collect up to 7 soup per action and can carry up to 100 total soup.  Miners can also deposit their soup in a refinery, where it is processed and then added to the team's soup pool.
